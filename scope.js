// Anything variables decleared inside the curley brackets comes under the block scope variables are only accesseble under the block
// not outside the block but var are free of that and it can also be accessed outside the block.



 a= 700;
{
     a= 100;
}
console.log(a); // a got changed same a outside the block goes inside the block. that's why we use let for create
//variables.

//There are two ways to decleare function one is direct and other one is by storing function into a variable
// so when we do so we are not use expression before it's declearation but we can use function before its declearation.
// and this is called hoisting
